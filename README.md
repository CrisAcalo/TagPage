This is a project that I create to learn testing in Laravel. It was developed with TDD methodology. For the momento you can find the test for Home view, Create and Delete operations and Validations.

### Considerations
To run the project just clone the repository, configure your own .env file, run `composer install`, `composer update` (if it's necessary), and `php artisan serve`
